# Ilham — Project Portfolio

Welcome 👋  
This portfolio represents my journey transitioning into a **Business Data Analyst with Data Science and Applied AI capabilities**, focusing on building systems that support **real-world decision making**, not just technical experimentation.

Rather than treating projects as isolated analyses, I design solutions that connect:

- data → interpretation → decision → business value

This page highlights both my overall project landscape and several **signature projects** that best represent how I approach data problems.

# ⭐ Signature Project 1  
## Retail Operational Prioritization & Risk Typology System

### Problem Background
Retail teams operate under limited planning bandwidth while facing volatile demand signals. Traditional KPIs often fail to answer a critical operational question:

> Where should attention be focused first — and why?

### Objective
Build a **decision-support framework** that transforms transactional retail data into operational prioritization signals.

### Dataset
Instacart Market Basket Analysis Dataset (Kaggle).

### Approach
The project introduces a **decision-first analytical framework**:

1. Metric Operationalization  
   - demand volatility  
   - reorder behavior  
   - concentration risk

2. Decision Framing  
   - Impact vs Risk axes
   - Priority bucket assignment

3. Diagnostic Layer  
   - risk archetypes
   - planning interpretation signals

All phases produce frozen artifacts to ensure reproducibility and auditability.

### Tools & Tech
Python, Pandas, Analytical Modeling, Power BI

### Key Insight
Analytics becomes more valuable when reframed as **prioritization under uncertainty**, not prediction accuracy.

### Business Value
- Enables structured operational focus
- Improves planning clarity
- Supports executive-level decision reasoning

### My Role
- Framework design
- Metric engineering
- Decision logic formulation
- Executive narrative translation

# ⭐ Signature Project 2  
## Context-Aware Coffee Recommendation System

### Problem Background
Traditional recommendation systems optimize similarity but ignore real-world user context, producing technically correct but practically unsuitable recommendations.

### Objective
Design a recommendation system that balances **relevance with contextual suitability**.

### Approach

Two-stage architecture:

**1. Retrieval Layer**
- TF-IDF + cosine similarity for candidate generation.

**2. Guardrail Ranking Layer**
- Rule-based contextual scoring:
  - caffeine sensitivity
  - brew method
  - time of consumption
  - stomach tolerance

Rules act as business guardrails rather than replacing model relevance.

### Tools & Tech
Python, NLP (TF-IDF), Streamlit, Rule-Based Scoring

### Key Insight
Good recommendations require **judgment**, not only similarity.

### Business Value
- Explainable recommendations
- Safer user experience
- Flexible rule evolution without retraining models

### My Role
- Decision logic design
- Modeling workflow
- Evaluation strategy
- System deployment prototype

# ⭐ Signature Project 3  
## Demand Forecasting → Decision Support System

### Problem Background
Forecasting models often stop at prediction outputs, leaving stakeholders unsure how to act on results.

### Objective
Transform forecasting outputs into actionable planning signals.

### Approach
- Feature engineering & regression modeling
- Forecast interpretation layer
- Inventory and planning decision framing
- Scenario-oriented analysis

### Tools & Tech
Python, Time-Series Analysis, Regression Modeling

### Key Insight
Forecasts become valuable only when translated into decisions.

### Business Value
- Supports inventory planning
- Reduces ambiguity in forecast interpretation
- Bridges analytics and operations

### My Role
- End-to-end modeling
- Decision interpretation design
- Business framing
