I am a data practitioner transitioning into a Business Data Analyst role with Data Science capabilities.

Over time, I realized that data is not merely about numbers — it is a tool that helps people make more rational, fair, and impactful decisions. This realization motivated me to seriously pursue data analytics and data science as a long-term career path.
